 "# Stock_Price_Prediction-Algo" 
 
Introduction:
      This is a project developed to predict the future prices of stocks and commodities. The model uses Machine learning and LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)            techniques to predict the prices, However, It's still in developing phase, it's backend programming is almost done and it's frontend will be completed soon

Description:
      The model was developed on 'Google Colab' which is a user-friendly interface for budding developers.
      The data used was the previous years stock prices provided by 'Yahoo' 
      THe model trains with provided data and after analys it predicts the future price.
      Every single part of code is detailed and well-defined in a way that the reader can easily understand as I have provided explanations in the form of comments.
